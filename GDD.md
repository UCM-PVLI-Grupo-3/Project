## Synopsis

You are a time traveler switching between the future and the past. Your goal is to defeat the interdimensional entity that is causing a breach in space-time, twisting the world bringing together dangers from ancient times and unwitnessed futuristic hazards.

Equipped with what you gather from killing these enemies in turn-based, card and dice roll battles,
you must continue the path fighting waves of interdimensional altered emotions.

## Controls

The game controls are mostly UI-based and only need your mouse and your ability to press left click.
That makes it playable on a touchscreen too.

## Style

Smooth vector art with light saturated colors, similar to Dicey Dungeons. Clear telegraphy of any icons, buttons, actions or menu contexts.

### The game is structured as follows

When in a fight, the main card-and-dice-based mechanics of the game take over. The fight may conclude when you are killed by an enemy or when you succesfully kill all present in a fight, granting you with a card reward and advancing you to the next wave.

## Dynamics

When in a particular fight, the mechanics available enhance and leave clear various game-styles. Ones might bet all their dice to risky high attack cards. Whereas others might spread the love along all the card types; of defence, attack, heal. Or even be a personal fan of using the "reorganize dice" action and dynamically assign dice to different card type slots to adapt their strategies to the enemies dynamically.
Moreover, long term thinking is also present all whilst in a fight, given that the emotion stack is one more element to bear in mind. Allowing you to plan a sequence of card turns ahead to ~~gamble~~ roll your odds of getting the best of emotion combinations.

## Gameplay

In the player's turn, the UI will display the action menu, where the player can see the stack of emotions; **all dice distributed**, available for reorganisation; **attack, defense, and heal actions** with the button for choosing a card of the corresponding action type in each row, and **a bell to confirm** the player's choice for that turn.

When the player presses the button to select a card of one type, four cards of that action type from the whole collection of cards the player has are selected and showed to the player in a popped menu, the player chooses one of them and closes the turn by pressing the bell.

The player has the option to cancel the usage of the card or dice swap before pressing the bell. The strategy of the gameplay where the fun part of the combat appears is when the player faces enemies with specific weaknesses and strengths and the health points and the emotions of both the player and the enemies require another way of acting.

The rest of the battle will follow this dynamic of switching between the turns of the player and the turns of an enemy up to whatever enemy wave the player manages to get to.

## Mechanics

### Cards

The cards are the most important and principal mechanic in this game. They represent the actions the player can do during the fight, this being divided in three subclasses, each representing the cards main purpose: attack cards, they deal damage to the enemy; defense cards, they help the player receive less damage; Heal cards, they restores the players health; This been said it is possible to find a card that is a fusion of two types, like: attack/defense, attack/heal or defense/heal.

Besides their main action, the card may have side effect and an emotion. All of this actions outcomes are decided by the dices roll, the stats bonus, the dice bonus and the emotion bonus, all of this bonuses will be talked about later on.

### Emotions

As we have said before, a way of improving your chances at landing your cards is your emotion bonus. Most cards have emotions integrated in them and they are not just for show. Each time the dices are rolled when you play a card with an emotion, if your roll is on the higher epsilon you will receive that cards beneficial emotion. But beware one very bad roll and the card will give you a negative emotion.

### Dice organizing

As explained before on the gameplay analysis, during your turn you may change your dices position depending on the state of the battle and your strategy. You start each battle with a set number of different kinds of dices which vary from the d4 dice to the d20 dice.

By rearranging your dices you can place more or less dices in each action type: attack, defense, heal. Giving more dices to your attack will give you better probability on your rolls on attack cards, giving you not only more dices but also an additional dices bonus. But that's not the only bonus a dice can give, lets imagine, if you are fighting a cyborg that needs a 19 to be hit, you may think that using d20 dices is the best answer, but its not the best one its the safest one, and this game doesn't reward being safe.

Using lower dices like 3d8 will not only allow you to hit but it will give you a bonus for using a lower dice and an even bigger bonus if you use a 3 d6. That way the game doesn't only reward the smartest and most strategic players but the ones with an inner gambler.
